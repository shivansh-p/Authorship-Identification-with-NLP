### Abstract

Our paper proposes a new method for authorship identification that incorporates graph structures
and contrastive learning techniques. Authorship identification (AID) is the process of identifying the
author of a given text using the structure of the text and the author’s writing style. It is usually treated
as a text classification problem, which exhibits limitations when encountering real-world datasets
with too many authors to classify. To overcome this issue, we used a method similar to contrastive
learning, where the positive and negative pairs would be an article with its correct and incorrect
author features, respectively. We further improve the model’s performance by utilizing graph machine
learning, which could capture the inherent structure and relationships of authors and articles. In the
end, we increased the model’s AUC value from 73% to 79% on a sampled subset from the Citation
Network of DBLP.
